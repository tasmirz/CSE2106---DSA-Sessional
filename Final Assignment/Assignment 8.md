### **Assignment: Sorting Algorithms Implementation and Time Complexity Comparison (CO4)**

#### **Instructions**:

* Implement the following sorting algorithms in C++: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Radix Sort, and Count Sort.  
* For each algorithm, measure the execution time for sorting different sizes of input arrays.  
* Compare the time complexity of each algorithm theoretically and empirically.  
* Provide a report summarizing the findings and insights gained from the comparison.

#### **Sorting Algorithms**:

* Bubble Sort  
* Insertion Sort  
* Selection Sort  
* Quick Sort  
* Merge Sort  
* Heap Sort  
* Radix Sort  
* Count Sort

#### **Tasks**:

**Implementation:**

Write C++ code to implement each of the sorting algorithms listed above.

**Time Complexity Comparison:**

* Generate random arrays of different sizes (e.g., 1000, 5000, 10000 elements).  
* Use C++ chrono library to measure the execution time of each sorting algorithm for each input size.

**Theoretical Analysis**:

* Discuss the time complexity of each sorting algorithm in terms of best-case, average-case, and worst-case scenarios.  
* Compare the theoretical time complexities of the algorithms.

**Empirical Analysis:**

* Present the empirical time complexities obtained from the runtime measurements.  
* Analyze and compare the actual time complexities observed during execution.

**Report:**

* Prepare a report summarizing the implementation details, time complexity comparison, and insights gained.  
* Include tables or graphs to visualize the empirical time complexities.  
* Discuss any unexpected results or observations encountered during the analysis.

#### **Submission**:

* Submit the C++ source code files for each sorting algorithm.  
* Submit the report in a PDF format documenting the implementation details, time complexity comparison, and analysis.

#### Note:

* Ensure the code is well-commented and follows good coding practices.  
* Test the implementations thoroughly with **different input sizes and edge cases**.  
* **The marks obtained in this assignment will be added to the theory course assessment as well.**
